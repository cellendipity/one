Keyboard shortcuts
==================

Keys 1-8 select a predefined fill-colour:

1 Red
2 Yellow
3 Green
4 Cyan
5 Blue
6 Magenta
7 White
8 Black

9 increases fill hue (+2)
0 decreases fill hue (-2)

Mouseclick will spawn a cell at the current mouse location

Spacebar  Respawns with current settings
R         Respawns after randomizing most of the settings
P         Pauses/unpauses the main draw-loop (colours can be changed & new cells added while paused)
C         Toggles between 'centered spawn position' and 'random spawn position'
N         Toggles between 'show nucleus' and 'don't show nucleus'

Use F11 for browser fullscreen-mode & F5 to refresh and fill the whole screen.

Tip: You can save your favourite settings in the menu, but first you need to click on the 'gearwheel' icon at the top, 
then select "Automatically save values to localStorage on exit."
